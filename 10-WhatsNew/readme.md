## January 2026

### **🆕 New! Basic Chat App for OpenAI gpt-oss Model**

Try out our new [Basic Chat application](../samples/CoreSamples/BasicChat-07Ollama-gpt-oss) designed to test the [OpenAI gpt-oss model](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/). This sample demonstrates how to use the latest open-source model from OpenAI in a .NET console app, making it easy to experiment with conversational AI locally or in the cloud.

### **🖼️ Hugging Face MCP Server Image Generation Samples**

Explore new C# console app samples that show how to use the Hugging Face MCP Server to generate images directly from your code.

- [Try the sample using GitHub Models or Microsoft Foundry](../samples/CoreSamples/MCP-01-HuggingFace/Program.cs)
- [Use Ollama for local model inference](../samples/CoreSamples/MCP-02-HuggingFace-Ollama/Program.cs)

### **🕹️ Apps Generated with AI - Console GPU Viewer**

We've added a new sample to the Apps Generated with AI section:

- **[Console GPU Viewer](../samples/AppsWithGenAI/ConsoleGpuViewer/README.md)**: A lightweight console utility that demonstrates GPU diagnostics and how to integrate local model runners or visual tooling into console-based .NET apps. Useful for testing GPU availability before running local inference models.

### **🕹️ New! Apps Generated with AI**

We're excited to introduce a new section featuring full applications generated with AI tools like GitHub Copilot Agent. These apps demonstrate how generative AI can be used to build real-world .NET solutions leveraging AI as a co-pilot.

- **First Sample: SpaceAINet**
  - [SpaceAINet Console App](../samples/AppsWithGenAI/SpaceAINet/README.md)
  - **SpaceAINet** is an AI-powered Space Battle game for .NET 9, designed to showcase how modern AI models can play classic games. The solution allows you to run the game with either local AI models (via Ollama) or cloud-based models (via Microsoft Foundry), which analyze the game state and predict the next best action to win.
  - Try it out and see how AI can master classic arcade gameplay!
