Welcome to **BIG CHANGE FOR TESTTING**, the hands-on course for .NET developers diving into the world of Generative AI!

This isn’t your typical “here’s some theory, good luck” course. This repository is all about **real-world applications** and **live coding** to empower .NET developers to take full advantage of Generative AI.

This is **hands-on**, **practical**, and designed to be **fun**!

Don't forget to [star (🌟) this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars) to find it easier later.

➡️Get your own copy by [Forking this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/Generative-AI-for-beginners-dotnet/fork) and find it next in your own repositories.

## ✨ What's New

We're constantly improving this course with the latest AI tools, models, and practical samples:

- **🤖 NEW! Claude Models with Agent Framework**

  Integrate **Claude models** from Microsoft Foundry with Microsoft Agent Framework! Three comprehensive samples demonstrate:
  - Basic console chat with Claude using `ChatClientAgent`
  - Conversation persistence with thread serialization/deserialization
  - Interactive Blazor web chat application with modern UI
  - Custom `ClaudeToOpenAIMessageHandler` for seamless API bridging
  - Support for Claude Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus models
  
  👉 [Explore the Claude AgentFx Samples](./samples/AgentFx/CLAUDE-SAMPLES-README.md)
  
  Plus a foundational Claude integration sample:
  
  👉 [BasicChat with Claude via Microsoft Foundry](./samples/CoreSamples/BasicChat-11FoundryClaude/)

- **🌐 AG-UI Integration Sample**

  Check out our new Agent Framework sample demonstrating **AG-UI** (Agent Gateway User Interface) - the distributed agent architecture pattern! This sample shows how to:
  - Separate AI agent backend from Blazor frontend for better scalability
  - Use `AGUIChatClient` to communicate with remote agents over HTTP
  - Implement RAG with semantic search and PDF document ingestion
  - Orchestrate distributed applications with .NET Aspire
  
  👉 [Explore the AG-UI Sample](./samples/AgentFx/AgentFx-AIWebChatApp-AG-UI/README.md)

- **🤖 Microsoft Agent Framework (AgentFx) Lesson**

  We've added a comprehensive new lesson on the Microsoft Agent Framework - the next evolution in .NET AI development! Learn how to:
  - Build orchestrated AI agent systems with specialized roles
  - Create multi-model workflows combining GitHub Models, Microsoft Foundry, and Ollama
  - Integrate with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for enhanced capabilities
  - Design sequential and concurrent agent workflows for complex tasks

## 🚀 Introduction

Generative AI is transforming software development, and .NET is no exception. This course aims to simplify the journey by offering:

- Short 5-10 minute videos for each lesson.
- Fully functional .NET code samples you can run and explore.
- Integration with tools like **GitHub Codespaces** and **GitHub Models** for seamless setup and fast time-to-code. But if you want to run the samples locally with your own models, you can totally do that too.

You'll learn how to implement Generative AI into .NET projects, from basic text generation to building full-fledged solutions using **GitHub Models**, **Azure OpenAI Services** and **local models with Ollama**.

## 📦 Each Lesson Includes

- **Short Video**: A quick overview of the lesson (5-10 minutes).
- **Complete Code Samples**: Fully functional and ready to run.
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Simple instructions to help you learn and implement the concepts.
- **Deep Dive References**: This course focuses on the practical implementation of GenAI, to get deeper into the theoretical we also provide links to explanations in [Generative AI for Beginners - A Course](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners) when needed.
